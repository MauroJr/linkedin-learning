## ABOUT

* I was fedup with the missing download for Linkedin Learning courses. Here is a short ruby script to download linkedin learning videos directly to your drive. Nothing fancy but it works. You can adjust it accordningly. 

## INSTALL

* make sure to have ruby > 2.2.0
* gem install selenium-webdriver
* pip install youtube-dl

## RUN

* ruby lynda.rb
* When chrome opens, login and wait for the script to visit each course page and youtube-dl download the video.
